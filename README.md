This is a mini project created to deconstruct an extisting website and rebuild.
- I created a folder to house all the future projects, created a new repository for this project and moved it to my local machine. "I am making progress."

    I developed some skills on the following:
    - Moved a div around on the page
    - Sticked a div onto the bottom or top of the page
    - Identify the background color of an existing webpage
    - Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
    - Center an element horizontally
    - Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
    - Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
    - Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
